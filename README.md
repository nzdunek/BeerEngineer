# BeerEngineer

The goal of the project is to create an application that selects the right type of beer tailored to the user's preferences and allows to explore new products.

The inspiration for the idea of Beer Engineer were people who, going to a multitap bar for the first time, were overwhelmed by the number of types of beer and the huge differences between the different types.

The application is directed to two types of recipient:
- a Beer-Laic, who is just beginning his adventure with beer

- a Beer-Warrior with specific taste preferences, knowing the market but wanting to have an insight into new products.
